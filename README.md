# COMP150-AssistiveAlgorithms

Assistive Algorithms is a course that I took at Tufts University as part of my graduate studies. This course focuses on computational approaches that provide assistance to human users. These approaches take into account the users by sensing their behaviours, modeling their goals and plans, and intelligently (as well as socially) choosing appropriate actions.

Case studies on the state-of-the-art approaches such as smart prosthetics, socially assistive robotics and smart home assistants were also discussed and similar were implemented through weekly programming assignments.
